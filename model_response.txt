| Step | What to do | Where to find it in the video |
|------|------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | **Install Anaconda** (if you don’t already have it). The instructor links to a separate video that walks through the Anaconda installation on Windows. | Video #5, **0 – 5 s** (intro) and **25.7 – 30.8 s** (link to the Anaconda video). |
| 2 | **Create a new conda environment** (recommended) or use your base environment.
